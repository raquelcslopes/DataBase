# DataBase

This Java project demonstrates how to connect to a database using JDBC, perform basic operations, and manage user data.

## Project Structure
- `Main.java`: Main class to run the program.
- `DBConnection.java`: Manages the database connection and related operations.
- `Client.java`: (Describe the purpose of this class, if applicable.)

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher).
2. Set up the appropriate JDBC driver for your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   javac src/*.java
   ```
4. Run the main class:
   ```sh
   java -cp src Main
   ```

## Database Configuration
- Update the connection information in the `DBConnection.java` file as needed (URL, user, password).

## Notes
- Make sure the database is running before starting the program.
- Adapt the SQL queries according to your database schema.
